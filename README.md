<b><u><span style="font-size:larger;"> Tennis Conditions App </span></u></b>


**Project Overview:**

Introducing the Tennis Conditions App, designed specifically with tennis players in mind. While general weather apps provide comprehensive weather information, they often lack specific details tailored to tennis needs. That's where our app comes in.

My goal is to provide tennis players with the essential weather information necessary to determine if playing conditions are suitable for a game. I've carefully curated the features to focus on the factors that directly impact tennis gameplay.

<b><u><span style="font-size:larger;"> Key Features: </span></u></b>

Tennis-Focused Weather Data: Unlike generic weather apps, we prioritize the weather elements that matter most to tennis players. Get instant access to data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation specifically relevant to your tennis sessions.

Playability Benchmark: Every player has their own preferences and tolerance for different weather conditions. The app allows you to set your personal playability benchmark, enabling you to make informed decisions about whether the weather is favorable for your game.

Time-Saving: No need to sift through irrelevant weather details. Our app provides concise and relevant information tailored specifically for tennis players, saving you time and effort.

Enhanced Decision Making: With our playability benchmark feature, you can assess weather conditions against your personal preferences, ensuring you make informed decisions about whether to hit the courts or wait for better conditions.
